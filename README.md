 ## Description 
  
I built this app for users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

 I create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes by  building the backend and connect the frontend. To deploy (view online) [CLICK ME.](https://rabiahh-notetaker-express.herokuapp.com/notes)

* The following HTML routes were created to make these functions possible:


  * GET `/api/notes` - To read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST `/api/notes` - To receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - To receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete.
